        <div id="Bar_chart"></div>

        <p>China has the highest overall level of CO₂ emissions, producing 11.680 gigatons (11.68 billion tons, or 11,680 million tons) of CO₂ emissions in 2020, followed by the United States with 4.535 gigatons and India with 2.412 gigatons. However, it is worth noting that these are also the world's three most populous countries, so their high rank among emitters of CO₂—which is released predominantly though
             transportation networks and electricity production—can be credited in no small part to their higher overall populations. </p>
