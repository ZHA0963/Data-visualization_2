        As can be seen from the world map, a city is selected from each country to represent the national geographic location, the size of the circle represents the concentration of carbon dioxide emissions, and the larger the circle, the higher the concentration, and vice versa

        <div id="Bar_chart" style="float: left; left: 5%;"></div>

        <p>In 2020, <span style=" color: red;">China</span>'s total carbon dioxide emissions will be 11.68 billion tons, ranking first in the world. It was followed by the United States (4.535 billion tons) and India (2.412 billion tons). It's worth noting, however, that these are also the three most populous countries in the world, so their high ranking among carbon dioxide emitters - which is mostly released through transport networks and electricity production - can largely be attributed to their higher total populations.

        <p>As the second largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the <span style=" color: red;">United States</span>, the control of carbon emissions is also crucial.
        <p>This chart shows that the carbon dioxide emissions in the <span style=" color: red;">United States</span> are decreasing year by year, and there is a small rebound in 2021, which is a good trend, because the control of carbon dioxide can reduce the greenhouse effect and achieve sustainable development.

        <div id="pie_chart" style="float: left; left: 6%;"></div>

        <p>Carbon dioxide is mainly caused by the burning of fuels, including coal, oil, gas, cement, flaring, and other industries. In order from most to least carbon dioxide emissions, <span style=" color: slateblue;">coal, oil and gas</span> are the main ones.

        <p>According to the bar chart, we can know the specific values, and get a more intuitive sense of the carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of different fuels
